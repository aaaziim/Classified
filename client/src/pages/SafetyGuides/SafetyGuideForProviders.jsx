          </div>
<div className='space-y-4 mt-4'>

          {/* Section 1 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">1. Verify Potential Clients</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li><strong>Request a Consultation Call:</strong> Use Zoom, Google Meet, or FaceTime to speak face-to-face with a potential client before meeting in person. This helps you:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                  <li>Verify their identity.</li>
                  <li>Understand their expectations and needs.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Gather as much information as possible about the service they need, the location, and any special requests before agreeing to meet.</li>
              <li><strong>Research the Client:</strong> Check social media or online profiles to ensure they are legitimate.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 2 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">2. Use Secure Communication Channels</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>Keep initial conversations on the platform where you are advertising your services. Avoid sharing personal phone numbers or email addresses until trust is established.</li>
              <li>Be cautious of clients who rush to take conversations offline.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 3 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">3. Meet in Safe, Public Spaces</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li><strong>For first-time meetings, choose a public, well-lit location:</strong> A coffee shop or coworking space is ideal to discuss details or perform services that can be completed outside of private residences.</li>
              <li><strong>Bring Someone Along:</strong> If possible, have a friend or colleague accompany you for added safety during the first meeting.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 4 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">4. Know Your Surroundings</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li><strong>Share Your Location:</strong> Inform a friend or family member of where you’re going, who you’re meeting, and when you expect to return. Use location-sharing apps for real-time tracking.</li>
              <li><strong>Have an Exit Strategy:</strong> Always park in a spot where you can leave quickly, and trust your instincts to walk away if something feels “off.”</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 5 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">5. Handle Payments Securely</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li><strong>Avoid Upfront Payment Issues:</strong> Do not accept payments via untraceable methods, such as cash apps without business verification or wire transfers. Use secure and trackable platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle.</li>
              <li><strong>Request Deposits for Large Services:</strong> If providing a large service, require a deposit upfront. Be clear and provide written confirmation for all payment terms.</li>
              <li><strong>Never Offer Free Services:</strong> If a client asks for a “test run” or a discount in exchange for exposure, proceed with caution. Your time and skills are valuable.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 6 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">6. Protect Personal Information</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>Avoid sharing private information like your home address, Social Security number, or personal financial details. Use a P.O. Box or virtual business address if needed.</li>
              <li>Use a separate phone number for work purposes via apps like Google Voice or a business phone line.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 7 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">7. Know the Scope of Work</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>Before agreeing to any project, clearly define the scope of work, fees, and deliverables. Get these details in writing through contracts, emails, or text confirmations.</li>
              <li>Be cautious if a client frequently changes expectations or requests services outside of what was agreed upon.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 8 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">8. Maintain Professional Boundaries</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">

              <li>Share pictures, videos, or samples of your work via professional platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, or a personal website. Avoid sharing sensitive or private information.</li>
              <li>Watermark your photos or videos if showcasing unique work to protect your intellectual property.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 10 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">10. Trust Your Instincts</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>If something feels wrong or a client is being overly demanding or vague, it’s okay to decline the opportunity. Safety comes first.</li>
              <li>Develop a polite but firm way to say “no” to clients who are unprofessional or disrespectful of your boundaries.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 11 */}

              <li>For services such as hair styling, massage therapy, or fitness, always practice professional hygiene standards. Sanitize tools, equipment, and personal spaces before and after use.</li>

            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Section 12 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">12. Maintain a Professional Online Presence</h3>
